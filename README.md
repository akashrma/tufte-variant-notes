# tufte-variant-notes
Notetaking inspired by [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) and [Gilles Castel](https://castel.dev/).

## June 9, 2024
Unpolished at the moment. Forked from [Gilles Castel's Master's Thesis](https://github.com/gillescastel/masterthesis). This template aims to be a starter for permanent personal notes. 

**Compilation:** Use Overleaf (works out of the box) or a local $\LaTeX$ package manager. Compile using pdfLaTeX+BibLaTeX, LatexMk+BibLaTeX or pdfLaTeX+Biber. 

# Upcoming Features/Functionality

- [ ] Sample usage document with all functionality. Similar to [Tufte Style Book](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/a-tufte-style-book-with-vdqi-title-and-contents-page/xqkjxvmrhmmp).
- [ ] Proper full-width figures with captions (it does not seem to work at the moment).
- [ ] Add new commands for common usage in CS, programming and ML.
- [ ] Add customization options for specific workflows - research notes and class/subject notes.
